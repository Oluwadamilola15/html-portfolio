    <h1>Best movie according to Oluwadamilola</h1>
<h2>My top 5 movies of all times.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Scholars that work at night</h3>
<p>This has been one of my favorite korean hostorical movie. it is a fantasy movie which involves Vampires, scary? lol, it's not.</p>
<p>
I would rate it a 9 out of 10.<br />
<p>

<h3>Merlin</h3>
<p>Merlin is such an amazing movie that i had watched almost 10 times, you're surprised? don't be, it's because of how engrossing it is. It is a funny movie and i would rate a 10 out of 10</p>
<p>
It's an old movie though,but its worth everything.<br />
<p>

<h3>The K2</h3>
<p>The K2 is kdrama packed with actions, love, revenge. In all, it is a rollercoaster of emotions with a rating of 9 out of 10.</p>

<h3>The Judge from hell</h3>
<p>Hmmmmmmm, if you're looking for a movie that would keep you on your toes with suspence, laughter, love, forgiveness and more expectations. Then, here it is. I've always loved the female lead, so loving the drama wasn't hard. You would definiely enjoy it. A 10 out of 10.</p>

<h3>The Good Doctor</h3>
<p>This has an America and a korean version, but i had only seen the former. This tells a story of a doctor who has Autisim and struggling with sociality. Dr Shaun Murphy almost made me develop a rising bp whenever he zones out. Some of my favorite character are Claire,Morgan,Lea and many more. I'm presently watching it for the 4th time and it's a 10 minus nothing.</p>
